    <h1><ins>Smart Payment Ring(SPR):-</ins></h1>
    <br>
    <h2><ins>Introduction:-</ins></h2>
    <br>
A smart ring is a compact wearable electronic device that <strong>combines mobile technology with features for convenient on-the-go use.</strong>  These devices, typically designed to fit on a finger like a traditional jewelry ring, can offer functionalities like mobile payments, access control, gesture control, and activity tracking. Their most common feature is <em><ins>near-field communication (NFC)</ins> </em> , providing similar capability to what is built into many smart cards such as credit cards and employee security badges. Thus, they can be used for identification and payments.

    <h2><ins>Prerequisite For Using SRP:-</ins></h2>

<ol type="1">
    <li>You need a bank account or credit/debit card from a bank that supports contactless/NFC payments (like Visa, Mastercard, or RuPay in India).

The bank must allow tokenization for wearable devices.

Some rings require you to link them through your bank app or a specific ring-provider app.</li><br>
    <li>The ring itself must have built-in NFC (Near-Field Communication) technology.

        It should be compatible with your countrys payment network (e.g., UPI, Visa, Mastercard, etc.).</li><br>
        <li>The stores or services where you want to pay must have contactless POS machines (look for the wave-like “contactless” symbol).
            
            Without NFC-enabled terminals, the ring wont work.</li><br>
            <li>Some rings need a smartphone app to:

                Register or activate the ring.
                
                Link it to your bank card.
                
View transactions or add funds.

Your phone should support NFC if the setup process involves tapping the ring to the phone.</li><br>
<li>You must complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification if required by your bank or payment provider.
    
    You may need to set up PIN/OTP authorization for linking the ring.</li><br>
